#ctgGEM (cell tree generator for Gene Expression Matrices)



ctgGEM is an R package that combines a variety of visualization packages for single cell RNA tree hierarchies.  This package provides users with a streamlined, simplified way to construct hierarchies from the workflows of these packages using one function call with a single centralized data object and the desired visualization package name as a parameter. Currently supported packages are:

- [cellTree](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cellTree.html)
- [destiny](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/destiny.html)
- [monocle](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/monocle.html)
- [sincell](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sincell.html)
- [TSCAN](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TSCAN.html)

For a guide on using the features of ctgGEM and the types of data required for each visualization, please see the package vignette.
